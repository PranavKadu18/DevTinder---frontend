          Welcome to DevTinder! Before you start swiping and finding your next
          coding (or life) partner, let’s lay down some ground rules:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">💖 1. Age and Eligibility</h1>You must be 18+ to use DevTinder — this
          ain't kindergarten, folks. 😎
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">🚫 2. Keep It Friendly, Pookie!</h1>We’re all about friendly vibes here.
          Any form of abuse, hate speech, harassment, or disrespectful behavior
          will get you the boot faster than a failed npm install. 👋 If you
          can't keep it respectful, you're out — no exceptions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">🔒 3. Data Privacy</h1> Your personal data (profile info, messages, etc.)
          stays with us — no shady third-party sharing. We value your trust, so
          no creepy data selling here. 🙌
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">💬 4. Paid Features</h1> Some features (like the chat) are premium, but
          don’t worry — it’ll only cost you the price of a Samosa and Mountain
          Dew. Cheap thrills, right? 😏
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">👀 5. No Guarantees</h1> We’re not Cupid. If things don’t work out, it’s on
          you — DevTinder just sets the stage; the magic (or disaster) is up to
          you. 😉
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">🚨 6. Account Suspension</h1> If you break the rules or engage in abusive
          behavior, we’ll suspend your account faster than your WiFi drops
          during a Zoom call. 🫠
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By signing up, you agree to these terms. Now stop reading — go find
          your match! 😎🔥
        </p>
